### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is DÃ¡niel SzabÃ³, I am a software developer and creator from Hungary, currently enjoying life in Scotland.

I am very passionate about humane technology, low-tech and FOSS, currently focusing on [MicroBin](https://github.com/szabodanika/microbin) and learning Rust programming.

For business enquiries send me a digital letter at [d@szab.eu](mailto:d@szab.eu). For more stuff and contacts check out my website [szab.eu](https://szab.eu).

If I reach out to you, that will be from either [d@szab.eu](mailto:d@szab.eu) or [daniel.szabo99@outlook.com](mailto:daniel.szabo99@outlook.com).

I recommend encrypting sensitive messages via GPG: [my GPG public key](https://szab.eu/assets/files/daniel-szabo-pub.asc).

Cheers,
Dani
