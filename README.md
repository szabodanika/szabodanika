### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello, my name is DÃ¡niel SzabÃ³, I am a software developer and creator originally from Hungary, recently left Scotland after four years and currently enjoying life in Oulu, Finland, working towards my Master's degree in Computing.

When I'm not working on or exploring open-source projects I am either outside exploring and taking photos. Currently I am very passionate about humane technology, low-tech and FOSS.

For business enquiries send me a [digital letter](mailto:d@szab.eu). You can also reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/d-szabo/).

Cheers,
Dani
