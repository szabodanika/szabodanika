### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello, my name is DÃ¡niel SzabÃ³, I am a software developer and creator originally from Hungary, currently based in Oulu, Finland,  busy working towards my Master's degree in Computing. 

My open source projects mostly get maintenance during summer breaks, I apologise if I am slow to response to requests.

For business enquiries send me a [digital letter](mailto:d@szab.eu). You can also reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/d-szabo/).

Cheers,
Dani
